# Climabot

Discord bot with weather information from the openweathermap.org

## Configuration

First you will have to create a *.env* file in the directory where you have cloned the bot with the following contents:

```txt
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_token_goes_here
OPENWEATHER_KEY=your_openweather_key_goes_here
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id_goes_here
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret_goes_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_secret_key_goes_here
```

And replace with your services tokens.

## How to run the bot

After you uncompress the zip file, you can run the bot with `python3 climabot-master` (or the directory name that contains the bot's files) or you can also `cd` into the bot's base directory and run `python3 .`
